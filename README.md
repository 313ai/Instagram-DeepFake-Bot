# Instagram-DeepFake-Bot
An Instagram Bot serving as an account, people can use to create DeepFakes on Instagram.


# Disclaimer:
The code needed a lot of configuring in order to work in my specific workplaces. 
I tried making it as easy as possible to run it yourself. Errors may occur!
(Also this code only serves as a "show - off" and is not intended to be run since Instagram's terms of services strictly prohibits this.)
Run it at your own risk.


## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites & Installation

* Code was written and tested in Python 3.6.5 and 3.6.10
* Install the requirements.txt
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Install autocrop
```pip install autocrop```
  * locate autocrop (/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/autocrop)
  * replace entire folder with [my updated autocrop](https://github.com/dome272/Instagram-DeepFake-Bot/face_detection/autocrop)
* deepfake.py requires numpy=1.15 -> we need a feature from numpy=1.16
  * locate numpy-core (/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/numpy/core)
  * replace function_base.py with [my updated numpy function_base.py](https://github.com/dome272/Instagram-DeepFake-Bot/files/function_base.py)
* Additional things:
  * ffmpeg
  * cuda
  * opencv (I had to recompile it on Ubuntu 18.04.4) -> [Install Opencv](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) and follow [this guide](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/8471#issuecomment-321199220)
  * GPU (I used a GTX 1080 renting on [vast.ai](https://vast.ai/console/create/))
  

### Running it

1. Edit [main.py](https://github.com/dome272/Instagram-DeepFake-Bot/main.py) on line 596 with your account details.
2. ```python3.6 main.py```
3. Wait for the Instagram-Login to happen.
4. Wait for Checker-,Editor-,and Sender-Class to be initialised.


### Adding ranks to users
1. Go to [other_tools](https://github.com/dome272/Instagram-DeepFake-Bot/other_tools)
2. Run ```python3.6 add_donator username rank```
  * Rank 1: 30 seconds videos + priority queue
  * Rank 2: 45 seconds videos + priority queue + watermark removal
  * Rank 3: 60 seconds videos + priority queue + watermark removal
  * (Every other user is initially Rank 0)

### Checking stats
* all stats can be found in log.json

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
